QA Test

The purpose of this app is to serve as an interview project for potential QA testers.
There is a qualitative and a quantitative portion.

Qualitatively we are looking for clear descriptions, reproduction steps, screenshots, and potentially fix suggestions for the bugs in the Quantitative portion.

Quantitatively there will be 3 classes of bugs in the test app, classed easy, medium, and hard based on perceived difficulty of noticing/identifying them.
